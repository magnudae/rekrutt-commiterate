Local commIterate
===================

Small application for showing off your local lolcommits.
Made for itDAGENE and dagen@ifi.

To use if for yourself you have to download lolcommits(https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits) and follow their instructions.

Then you have to make a symlink to your own gifs-folder.
